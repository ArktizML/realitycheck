            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <p>
                Define what you expect to achieve.
                No vague goals. Just numbers and clarity.

            <h3>Reality</h3>

                Come back later and record what actually happened.
                Reality never lies.

            <h3>Close the Gap</h3>
            <p>
                See the difference between intention and execution
                — and improve until you hit 100%.

        <h2>Why RealityCheck?</h2>
        <p>
            Most plans fail not because people lack ambition,
            but because they never confront reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            RealityCheck forces honesty — and rewards consistency.
